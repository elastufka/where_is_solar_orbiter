## Units

All coordinates are given in Heliocentric Earth Ecliptic (HEE) coordinates. For clarity, they are displayed in AU although the data can also be downloaded in .csv format with units in km.

### Data update frequency

New coordinates are added once a day. New solar flares are added twice a week, after the updates to the [STIX Data Center.](https://pub023.cs.technik.fhnw.ch/)


Of course, this tool is based off of [the STEREO orbit tool](https://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/where.shtml) and others like it.

# Solar Flares

The solar flares are from the STIX database.

## Data Sources
STIX solar flares - [STIX Data Center](https://pub023.cs.technik.fhnw.ch/)
AIA solar flares - [HEK](https://www.lmsal.com/hek/)

## Calculations

Converting STIX peak counts to a [GOES-class proxy](https://pub023.cs.technik.fhnw.ch/wiki/index.php?title=GOES_Flux_vs_STIX_counts)

## About the plots
axes units for aia and stereo are arcsec, even though apparent disk size for stereo does vary by <10", it is still much less than solar orbiter

### Data update frequency

New solar flares are added twice a week, after the updates to the [STIX Data Center.](https://pub023.cs.technik.fhnw.ch/)
